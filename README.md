# Singapore_flat_resale_predictor
This repository consists of my singapore flat resale value predictor

## Problem statement 
- Develop a machine learning model for predicting resale prices of flats in Singapore using historical transaction data.

- Deploy the model as a user-friendly web application to assist potential buyers and sellers in estimating resale values.

- Provide a comprehensive solution for the prediction of resale flat prices, enhancing transparency in the real estate market.

  ## Solution approach

### Data Collection and Preprocessing:

-Collect and preprocess HDB resale flat transaction data from 1990 to present date for cleaning and structuring, ensuring suitability for machine learning.

### Feature Engineering:

-Extract relevant features (town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, lease commence date) and create additional features for improved prediction accuracy.

### Model Selection and Training:

Choose a regression model (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or random forests), and train it on a portion of the dataset for historical resale flat transactions.

### Model Evaluation:

Assess predictive performance using regression metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 Score.

### Streamlit Web Application:

Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input flat details for resale price prediction based on the trained machine learning model.
